We find here few developments that would help me gest started using Asciidoc for document generation.

We find here:
  * The typical directory organization
  * Examples of *.adoc documents I built
      * Have a look here to go further in document formatting : [Asciidoctor User Manual](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/)
  * Custom style document that better suits my needs
      * Have a look here to customize further PDF rendering : [Asciidoctor PDF Theming Guide](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc)
  * AsciiDoc_Gen_Script that packages PDF document generation
